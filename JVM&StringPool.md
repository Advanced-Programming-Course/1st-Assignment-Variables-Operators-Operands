The String Pool is a storage area in the JVM memory used for storing String objects. When a new String is created, the JVM first checks the String Pool. If a String with the same value exists in the String Pool, it uses that existing String for the new variable. If not, a new String is created in the String Pool and assigned to the new variable.


**Example 1:**
In the first example, both variables s1 and s2 point to the string "hello world!". Since the same String exists in the String Pool for both variables, the JVM uses it. As a result, s2 == s1 will evaluate to true.


**Example 2:**
In the second example, s1 points to the string "hello world!" in the String Pool, but s2 is created using the new String("hello world!") method. This creates a new String in memory, even though "hello world!" exists in the String Pool. Consequently, s1 and s2 point to two different Strings, and s2 == s1 will evaluate to false.


**Solution to Get "true" in Example 2 - Method 1:**
To get "true" in the second example, you can use the intern() method. This method checks the String Pool for the string, and if it exists, it returns that String. Otherwise, it creates a new String in the String Pool and assigns it to the new variable.
```java
String s1 = "hello world!";
String s2 = new String("hello world!").intern();
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true
```


**Solution to Get "true" in Example 2 - Method 2:**
Use the equals() method to compare two Strings based on their content. If the contents of the two Strings are the same, equals() returns true. In the example below, equals() is used to compare the contents of s1 and s2:
```java
String s1 = "hello world!";
String s2 = new String("hello world!");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
```


- Using equals() to compare the contents of two Strings is always the correct approach, especially when considering the String Pool.
- Using == is appropriate only when you want to check whether two Strings point to the same String in the String Pool or not.
